# About Me

üë®‚Äçüéì **Second-year Engineering Student**  
Specializing in **Robotics** and **3D Printing**. My academic and personal projects have provided hands-on experience in:

- **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design)  
- **Product Design**  
- **Arduino-like Controllers**  
- **Robotic Systems using 3D Printing Technologies**

I‚Äôve successfully developed and integrated both **hardware** and **software** solutions, applying rigorous engineering principles to address real-world challenges.

## Technologies and Skills

- **Programming Languages**:  
  - **C++** (for 3D printer firmware modifications)  
  - **Arduino** (for robotics projects)  
  - **Python** (for Machine Learning)

- Strong foundation in **problem-solving** and applying engineering concepts to practical scenarios.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I've worked on!
